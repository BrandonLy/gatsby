The gun and helmet represent his time spent in the army. The bag of money symbolizes his vast wealth. The mask demonstrates that even we learned about his past, there’s still a whole other side to him. The daisy flying away shows his futile attempts to reclaim her love."/></a></li>

        <li><a href="assets/chapterimg/c6.jpg"><img src="assets/chapterimg/c6.jpg" alt="This image is of Gatsby peering into the past. His inability to move on is eating away at him internally. The past can never be reclaimed, which is something Gatsby has a hard time comprehending."/></a></li>
