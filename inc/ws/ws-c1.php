        <p><i>“In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.”</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>As the opening paragraph of the first chapter, this paragraph establishes many factors that carry over into not only the rest of the chapter, but the entirety of the book as well. The most daunting part of the sentence is the its meaning and diction which portrays the speaker as a person who faces great pressure and oppression in society, sowing the seeds that will become the problem that is prevalent throughout the story. “More vulnerable years...” forces upon a more reminiscent tone that builds up tension within the reader. It’s grasping tone is directed towards the reader by fulfilling its duty as a hook, while patiently waiting for the line and sinker.</p>
