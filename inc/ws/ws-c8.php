        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning would be too late”
(Fitzgerald 157)</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>The tone of this excerpt is dark, and sets up the mood for the rest of the chapter: grim, black, and depressing. However, it also establishes a conclusive tone, with the feeling that the end is near. Nick fears that the horrors of his dreams will manifest themselves into reality. These nightmares of his represented the growing turmoils and the cascading consequences that resulted from Gatsby. The fact that he “jumped” out of bed and rushed out of the door signified that he wholeheartedly believed that something bad was going to happen and that he cared enough to go do something about it before it was too late. Foreshadowing the demise of Gatsby, Fitzgerald places this opening paragraph as an appetizer and as a conclusion. The end of the rising action, the conflicts, and the love disparity, and the beginning of a new decade for Nick, who recently turned 30 and would start it off with the conclusion of a man’s life.</p>
