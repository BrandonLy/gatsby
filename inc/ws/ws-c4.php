        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern Europe and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in the their somber holiday. As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us driven by a white chauffeur in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.”</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>As Nick Carraway travels alongside the “Great” Gatsby, they passed by a morbid train of cars that reflected the grandeur and elegance that was Gatsby. As Gatsby was revealing his past to Nick, Nick notices two carriages and ruefully remarks about the ecstasy the passer-bys feel. Mourning men and women riding off to a funeral of a beloved, and passes by a gleaming, beautiful car with two young, rich men. This sight contours the relationship between Gatsby and Nick, a sort of dark despair, and a gleaming hope that have settled between the two, particularly in Gatsby whose past was being revealed slowly and haughty. Passing by three negroes, Nick notices the tension between the rich folk, reminiscent of what he has seen and experienced over in the East Egg, further enforcing the author’s emphasis on the “roaring 20s” and its impact upon the people’s lives. The last sentence also reinstates the racial discrepancies that were believed by white supremacists such as Tom while noting the more accepting perspectives of Nick. </p>
