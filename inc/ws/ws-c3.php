        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold, In the the main a hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.”</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>The party spirit lives strong in the roaring twenties, due to the massive success that came with the end of WWI and a prevailing sense of “Carpe Diem,” lingering in the hearts of men and women alike. However this party atmosphere was naught by a mask that hid the true feelings that have developed because of the party life. Festivities were still enjoyed to be sure, but the smiles were half fake, and only worn in front of people. The Roaring twenties were not so much as roaring as they were purring. Gatsby sets up these parties in response to the demands, knowing full well that the rich folk love their parties. He holds parties to please the rich, however that could not be the purpose of the constant parties. The constant parties give Gatsby a mysterious persona, one that has a clear purpose in his actions. However, the purpose is unknown contributing to misnomers, rumors, and mystery behind Gatsby.</p>
