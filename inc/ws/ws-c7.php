        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“‘You’re crazy!’ he exploded. ‘I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then— and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.’”
(Fitzgerald 140)</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>The climatic meeting and the guillotine that held Gatsby’s dreams were held in the heated apartments where the walls themselves were battered with verbal assaults. Gatsby lays out all his cards in his vain dream that he would win. However it was never anything more than just a dream, getting Daisy was something that he could not do. Desperate for Daisy, Gatsby proclaims that the marriage between Tom and Daisy was a “God Damned lie.” This effectively portrays Gatsby as a desperate man, in a desperate moment, as if he were in his final moments. Gatsby inadvertently linked his own life with his dream. The diction by Gatsby also contradicts his normally calm and composed demeanor. “Exploding” in his climax with insultive language, Gatsby put his dream, his only purpose in life, on the line. Gatsby then claims that Daisy’s real marriage is with him, however it is probable that even Gatsby doesn’t truly believe this and has accepted his fate with his emotional explosion or left his fate to Daisy’s decision unconsciously.</p>
