        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness-it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.”</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>Nick points out an unpleasantness that hangs in the air. This is significant because of the stigma that Gatsby’s parties have. He was known for having wild, loose parties heard about for miles around. Now all of a sudden there’s a “pervading harshness.” This feeling stems from Tom and by extension, Daisy. Fitzgerald’s loaded diction helps villainize their presence with words such as, “oppressiveness,” “unpleasantness,” and “harshness.” By making the readers view Tom and Daisy in a negative way, Fitzgerald manages to project the stereotype that people from East Egg are judgemental and obsessed with their social status. In the last line of the excerpt, Fitzgerald brings up a valid point. He is trying to convey that looking into the past can bring grief as a result of true, sometimes disdainful, knowledge of the present. </p>
