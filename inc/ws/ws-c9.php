        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.</br>
‘Left no address?’</br>
‘No.’</br>
‘Say when they’d be back?’</br>
‘No.’</br>
‘Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?’</br>
‘I don’t know. Can’t say.’</br>
I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: ‘I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you——”</br>

( Fitzgerald 175)</i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>When Nick calls up Daisy in response to the discovery of the body, Nick does it as an act of unconscious trust. Nick trusted Daisy to respond to what happened, to help him clear things up between him, her, and Gatsby, to be there in his time of need. In this situation Nick could not help but have the want to rely on someone else, to share the pressure with someone he knew and trusted. However Nick lost what little obligational trust he had when he learned that both he and Gatsby had been deserted. The fact that Daisy had deserted displays the proves that Gatsby had the stronger, almost one-sided, love and cared less for Gatsby then he had cared for her. She left to escape whatever consequences her actions have caused, and to ameliorate her problem with the escape itself. The tone of his word choice, a simplistic symphony, proposed the depressed feelings of Nick. He was left alone with this matter, with burden entirely his to shoulder and it is clear with Fitzgerald’s word choice that although Nick felt the heavy obligational burden, he also felt honor bound to do what was best for his friend. The most startling point is when Nick tells Gatsby himself to trust that he would get somebody for him. Traces of Nick’s honor can be evidently seen, however it also shows that Nick does not see himself as somebody who has the right to be by him, and for him. Therefore, Nick rushes out and works hard in order to find people to attend his funeral in Gatsby’s honor, to remember him. Nick did his best in respect to Gatsby without stepping too far out of line.</p>
