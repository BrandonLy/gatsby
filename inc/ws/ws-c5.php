        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p><i>“They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life, Then I went out of the room and down the marbles steps into the rain, leaving them there together.” (Gatsby 96). </i></p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>In this excerpt, Fitzgerald details Nick’s perception of the scene displayed before him, describing how Gatsby and Daisy were lost in their own ethereal world of affection. They were “possessed,” as he stated, by this glorious whimsy of reclaimed love. His loaded descriptors, such as “forgotten,” work to intensify his purpose and fully convey how consumed the two characters were in their own emotionally and memorially-derived euphoria. Their enthrallment was further explored by the author’s choice to include diction such as “remotely” that exemplifies their disregard of all that is not native to their self-created world of rekindled love.  </p>
