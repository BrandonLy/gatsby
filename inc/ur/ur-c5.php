        <h4>Selling bonds in the 1920s</h4>
        <p>Text Excerpts: <i>“‘I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—You see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?’ ‘Trying to.’” -Gatsby to Nick</i></p>
        <p>Explanation to relation to history: During the late 1920s, investors and commoners were frantically buying and selling bonds to hopefully earn a quick, bountiful profit. The commercial mortgage-backed securities turned into one of the most profitable investment assets of the 20s. During a conversation between Jay Gatsby and Nick Carraway, Gatsby mentions to Nick that selling bonds would be a very profitable option to make money at the time.</p>
        <p>Additional research: In May of 1928, bonds reached its highest point of $100.10 per bond. By April 1933, bonds fell dramatically to $24.75. About 80% of outstanding securities established between the years 1920 to 1929 fell short to meet the standards of their clients’ contracts.</p>
