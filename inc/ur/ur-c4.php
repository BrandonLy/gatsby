        <h3>Meuse-Argonne Advancement (The Battle of the Argonne Forest)</h3>
        <p>Text excerpts: <i>"I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance." -Gatsby</i></p>
        <p>Explanation of relation to history: The Meuse-Argonne Advancement was the bloodiest, as well as most crucial advancement to ending World War I. Americans pushed along the Argonne forest and besides the Meuse River in France, and toppled German establishments. Gatsby mentions that he was a first lieutenant who was famed for his leadership during the most important American/French advancement against Germany.</p>
        <p>Additional research on topic: American forces alone effectively cleared the German’s first line of defense in just one day.
Germans used cruel tactics, such as faking a surrender to American forces, to lure Americans out of the their trenches. With the further advancements made by French/American forces, more and more German prisoners of war appeared to be very young or very old, proving an insight on the German’s supply of soldiers.</p>
