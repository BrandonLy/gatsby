        <h3>The Party Lifestyle</h3>
        <p>Text excerpt: <i>“It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.”</i> -Nick Carraway</p>
        <p>Explanation of relation to history: Gatsby had let go of a popular lifestyle during the 1920s, the “party” lifestyle. Many young Americans were accustomed to party in wild, exciting celebrations to liberate life in the Americas. Many young girls were tempted to become flappers, or “girls in style”. With the Jazz Age roaring, these behaviours spread from east to west.</p>
        <p>Additional research on topic: Strange, new behaviours caused many matured Americans to question and criticize the whole phenomena, such as the Anti-Flirt Club. With this new, fun mentality in life, illegal gambling and bootlegging grew as it appealed to many of these participants.</p>
