        <h3>World War I Veteran Rehabilitation</h3>
        <p>Text excerpt: <i>“A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘come on have some lunch with me,’ I sid. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.”</i> - Jay Gatsby’s father to Nick Carraway</p>
        <p>Explanation of relation to history: After World War I, many veterans expected their bonus pay for serving their country, but with complications, the government had to delay their bonus pay for years to come. This led to veterans being jobless and, to some, severely injured from war-times, ranging from amputations to mental conditions, like Gatsby (without the injuries). This led to the protest of thousands of veterans in the nation’s capitol where they demanded for their salary</p>
        <p>Additional research on the topic: The Bonus Army was the name of these veterans who protested in front of the White House on May 1924. When the order was made to evacuate these protestors, two veterans were killed when shots were fired. After the whole evacuation was over, many were rushed to the hospital where men, women, and children were killed.</p>
