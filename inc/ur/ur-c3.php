        <h3>Jazz: The Devil’s Music</h3>
        <p>Text Excerpts: <i>“A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and between the numbers people were doing “stunts.”</i> -Nick Carraway</p>
        <p>Explanation of relation to history: Jazz was the buzz of entertainment in the 1920s. Big stars in Jazz rose, like Louis Armstrong, to fame from the African American culture. Originally from New Orleans, Jazz spread quickly to surrounding areas in the country, sparking the “rhythm of the devil” as some say that the craziness and commotion of young Americans partying.</p>
        <p>Additional research on topic: During the Jazz Age, the music genre jazz exploded in popularity to express liberation and celebration (fitting the occasion of post-WWI). As much as it was celebrated, jazz was also hazed by many celebrities, journalists and entrepreneurs, such as Henry Ford. As many of the faces of Jazz was African American, racial ties were made with Jazz and African Americans, being the “supposedly” cause of the Great Depression. </p>
