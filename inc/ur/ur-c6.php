        <h4>Underground Pipeline from Canada:</h4>
        <p>Text Excerpts: <i>“Contemporary legends such as the ‘underground pipe-line to Canada.’ attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.”  -Nick Carraway</i></p>
        <p>Explanation to relation to history: Due to the Prohibition laws between 1920 and 1933, alcohol was smuggled into the United States via “underground” passageways or secret courses to selected black markets and consumers. Nick Carraway makes reference to this phenomenon as a “legend” due to its secrecy between sellers and customers.</p>
        <p>Additional research: In much of Detroit, Michigan, the Purple Gang, an assortment of killers and thugs, controlled the flow of smuggled alcohol.Alcohol was smuggled via abandoned boats harbored in the Detroit River, underground passageways specifically for smuggling, and sunken houseboats</p>
