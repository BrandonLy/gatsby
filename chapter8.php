<div id="drawing"><img src="assets/chapterimg/c8.jpg" alt="A dead body floating in pool" /><p>Gatsby dies in this chapter along with Wilson. Wilson was convinced that the eyes must have been the eyes of god, thirsting for vengeance over Myrtle's death. This drove him to murder Gatsby in his pool. If the eyes were really those of God, then they must have been there to witness the fall of the Great Gatsby.</p></div>
