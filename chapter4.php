<div id="drawing"><img src="assets/chapterimg/c4.jpg" alt="A mask, duffle bag, rifle, and daisy" /><p>This chapter characterizes Gatsby. We learn a good deal about him but are still left in the dark. The gun and helmet represent his time spent in the army. The bag of money symbolizes his vast wealth. The mask demonstrates that even we learned about his past, thereâ€™s still a whole other side to him. The daisy flying away shows his futile attempts to reclaim her love.</p></div>
